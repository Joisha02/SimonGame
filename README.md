# SimonGame
Simon is an electronic game of memory skill. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.<br/>
With the help to HTML,CSS and jQuery a similar version of this game has been made.
